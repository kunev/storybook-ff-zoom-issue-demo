# Explanation

When stories are embedded in MDX from other files the resulting wrapping that
the `Canvas` does will use different mechanics to decide content size in
different browser.

When the `zoom` css property is available it will be used. When it isn't, height
is decided [based on the size of the component the story
renders](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/ui/components/src/Zoom/ZoomElement.tsx#L66).
However that seems to not be working correctly, as on Firefox this always result
to the wrapping `div` having a `height` property of `20` and the css `height`
property for it being set to `70`
([this](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/ui/components/src/Zoom/ZoomElement.tsx#L17)
seems to just add `50px` to the height)


See screenshots of how this page looks in
[Chrome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunev/storybook-ff-zoom-issue-demo/main/screenshots/chrome.png)
and
[Firefox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunev/storybook-ff-zoom-issue-demo/main/screenshots/firefox.png).

## Inlining an embedded story

If the story is directly inlined in the MDX file using the following code it
will render properly on all browsers.

```mdx
<Canvas>
  <Story name="inlined-demo">
    {() => {
      return (
        <>
          <Input label="one" />
          <Input label="two" />
          <Input label="three" />
          <Input label="four" />
          <Input label="five" />
          <Input label="six" />
          <Input label="seven" />
        </>
      )
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
```

Note that if you inspect the DOM for the rendered story below you will see the
parent `div` of the `.innerZoomElementWrapper` `div` has a `height` of `216`,
likely correctly calculated based on the rendered story's actual height.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="inlined-demo">
    {() => {
      return (
        <>
          <Input label="one" />
          <Input label="two" />
          <Input label="three" />
          <Input label="four" />
          <Input label="five" />
          <Input label="six" />
          <Input label="seven" />
        </>
      )
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Embedding a story from another file

Here is how this looks when a story from a different file is embedded using the
following syntax:

```mdx
<Canvas>
  <Story id="demo-input--demo" />
</Canvas>
```

Here if you inspect the DOM, the same `div` that has a `height` of `216` above
has a `height` of `20`. I'd guess that's some default minimum value set when the
story's actual height can't be determined.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="demo-input--demo" />
</Canvas>

## Referencing a story from the same file

If however we reference a story from the same file, its height is correctly
determined:

```mdx
<Canvas>
  <Story id="demo-embeding-stories--inlined-demo" />
</Canvas>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="demo-embeding-stories--inlined-demo" />
</Canvas>
